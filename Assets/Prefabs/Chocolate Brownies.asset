  recipeName: Chocolate Brownies
  ingredients:
  - 185g unsalted butter
  - 185g best dark chocolate
  - 85g plain flour
  - 40g cocoa powder
  - 50g white chocolate
  - 50g milk chocolate
  - 3 large eggs
  - 275g golden caster sugar
  instructions:
  - Cut 185g unsalted butter into small cubes and tip into a medium bowl. Break 185g
    dark chocolate into small pieces and drop into the bowl.
  - Fill a small saucepan about a quarter full with hot water, then sit the bowl
    on top so it rests on the rim of the pan, not touching the water. Put over a
    low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted, stirring occasionally to
    mix them.
  - Remove the bowl from the pan. Alternatively, cover the bowl loosely with cling
    film and put in the microwave for 2 minutes on High. Leave the melted mixture
    to cool to room temperature.
  - While you wait for the chocolate to cool, position a shelf in the middle of your
    oven and turn the oven on to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.
  - Using a shallow 20cm square tin, cut out a square of kitchen foil (or non-stick
    baking parchment) to line the base. Tip 85g plain flour and 40g cocoa powder
    into a sieve held over a medium bowl. Tap and shake the sieve so they run through
    together and you get rid of any lumps.
  - Chop 50g white chocolate and 50g milk chocolate into chunks on a board.
  - "Break 3 large eggs into a large bowl and tip in 275g golden caster sugar. With
    an electric mixer on maximum speed, whisk the eggs and sugar. They will look
    thick and creamy, like a milk shake. This can take 3-8 minutes, depending on
    how powerful your mixer is. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s ready when the mixture
    becomes really pale and about double its original volume. Another check is to
    turn off the mixer, lift out the beaters and wiggle them from side to side. If
    the mixture that runs off the beaters leaves a trail on the surface of the mixture
    in the bowl for a second or two, you\u2019re there."
  - Pour the cooled chocolate mixture over the eggy mousse, then gently fold together
    with a rubber spatula. Plunge the spatula in at one side, take it underneath
    and bring it up the opposite side and in again at the middle. Continue going
    under and over in a figure of eight, moving the bowl round after each folding
    so you can get at it from all sides, until the two mixtures are one and the colour
    is a mottled dark brown. The idea is to marry them without knocking out the air,
    so be as gentle and slow as you like.
  - Hold the sieve over the bowl of eggy chocolate mixture and resift the cocoa and
    flour mixture, shaking the sieve from side to side, to cover the top evenly.
  - "Finally, stir in the white and milk chocolate chunks until they\u2019re dotted
    throughout."
  - Pour the mixture into the prepared tin, scraping every bit out of the bowl with
    the spatula. Gently ease the mixture into the corners of the tin and paddle the
    spatula from side to side across the top to level it.
  - "Put in the oven and set your timer for 25 mins. When the buzzer goes, open the
    oven, pull the shelf out a bit and gently shake the tin. If the brownie wobbles
    in the middle, it\u2019s not quite done, so slide it back in and bake for another
    5 minutes until the top has a shiny, papery crust and the sides are just beginning
    to come away from the tin. Take out of the oven."
  - "Leave the whole thing in the tin until completely cold, then, if you\u2019re
    using the brownie tin, lift up the protruding rim slightly and slide the uncut
    brownie out on its base. If you\u2019re using a normal tin, lift out the brownie
    with the foil (or parchment). Cut into quarters, then cut each quarter into four
    squares and finally into triangles."
  - "They\u2019ll keep in an airtight container for a good two weeks and in the freezer
    for up to a month."
